# **Project Description**

This project demonstrates polymorphism in Java by creating an interface for 3D shapes. The program uses polymorphism to handle multiple shape types (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) through a single interface (Shape3DInterface). Each shape implements methods to calculate its surface area and volume.

## **Polymorphism Explanation**

Definition: Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types of objects.

In this project, an array of Shape3DInterface references stores objects of different types (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube). Despite being different, these objects share common behavior (methods surfaceArea() and volume()).
